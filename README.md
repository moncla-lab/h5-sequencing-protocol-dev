This repository contains protocols and info for sequencing H5Nx viruses. These protocols were developed to sequence from vRNA from positive diagnostic samples with the goal of sufficient coverage and depth for within-host variant analysis. With these protocols, we can sequence most H5Nx samples with ct values under 30 with fairly reliable coverage (>100X for all genes).

**Files:**

**RT and PCR protocol**

**Library preparation protocol**

**H5Nx_seq_primers** -spreadsheet containing primer info (primer sequences, pooling scheme, annealing temps)
**H5Nx_seq_primers** -primers spreadsheet in a markdown file format so you can look without downloading like excel sheet

**Project1Exp17-23_example_sheet** -example spreadsheets for experiment set-up and pooling/diluting calculations for 1 sequencing run of 10 samples in duplicate plus negative controls
